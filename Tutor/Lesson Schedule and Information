Note: I will count doing homework/assignment as a class (usually 1 hour class)
However, just checking your homework doesn't count as a class. 
This is flexible, so you can ask me if it's counted as a class or not.

Please attend every class as scheduling is not easy for me.
However, if you really can't attend a class, please let me know ASAP.

I will bill every month for the lesson fees on the 20th each month.
The deadline for payment is the 5th the following month.
For upcoming lessons on 20-30 (or 20-31) that month, I will include those in the bill.
So please attend those lessons.

Thank you for your cooperation. I'm looking forward to seeing good scores.
Work Hard and Never Give Up.
